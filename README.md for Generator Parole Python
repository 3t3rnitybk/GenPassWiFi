# Python Password Generator

This is a simple script written in Python to generate random 10-character WiFi passwords. The script generates passwords continuously and saves them in a text file.

## How to use

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the script is located.
4. Run the script with the command:
```
python3 generate_passwords_continuous.py
```
5. To stop the generation, press `Ctrl + C`.

6. The generated passwords will be saved in the `passwords_continuous.txt` file in the same folder.

## Script description

- The script uses the `random` and `string` modules to create passwords consisting of uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
- The passwords have a fixed length of 10 characters.
- Generates passwords continuously until the user manually stops the process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

Modified script for continuous generation until manually stopped
If you want to generate as many passwords as possible, you can use 
a script that continuously writes to the file until you manually stop it (Ctrl+C):
How it works:
1-You run the script.
2-It will generate and write passwords to a file continuously.
3-You stop with Ctrl+C when you think you've had enough.
Generating a very large number of passwords (in the order of tens or hundreds of millions, or even billions) is limited in practice by:

Disk storage space (the file will be very large)
Time required for generation and writing
Processing capacity of your computer
Disk space estimate
A 10-character password + a newline character takes up approximately 11 bytes.

For:

10 million passwords → ~110 MB
100 million passwords → ~1.1 GB
1 billion passwords → ~11 GB
